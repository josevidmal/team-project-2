## Description

This is a Node.js application for a Motorcycle Clubs (MC) to allow better control of
their members. The app allows you to create new users, new trips, and gives
you an overview of the trip details, so the members know how much time and
money they will spend going to the suggested destination. It has 2 types of
member, regular member and admin member. Only administrator roles can
create new trips, while both can have a display of their profile with a summary
of their information.

## Motivation

Currentyl most of the MCs in the world can't have a proper managment
of the people in the club due to a lack of tools to do so. The ones
available are under monthly subscriptions, which not every club can
afford. We want to give, both veteran and new riders the opportunity to
keep track of their riding expirience while keeping it simple, friendly and
useful.
